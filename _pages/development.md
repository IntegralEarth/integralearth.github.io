## IMI 2.0

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is responsible for about 30% of global warming. It is emitted from a variety of sources, including natural gas production, agriculture, and landfills. Reducing anthropogenic methane emissions is a critical step in combating climate change and protecting the environment. However, to implement mitigation strategies we must quantify methane sources, a challenging task that requires specialized equipment and expertise.

## Integral Earth Website

We are a group of researchers at Harvard University who have spent years developing reliable, peer-reviewed algorithms for quantifying and monitoring methane emissions. We have developed a new, open-source tool that allows anyone to quantify methane emissions anywhere in the world: the [Integrated Methane Inversion](https://imi.seas.harvard.edu). Our tool is based on the latest scientific research and is used globally by scientists around the world.
