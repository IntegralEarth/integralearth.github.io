<h2><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/arrow-trend-up.svg" width="30" height="30"> • The Methane Problem</h2>

Methane is a **potent greenhouse gas**, with a global warming potential over [**80 times greater than CO2 over a 20-year period**](https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight#:~:text=Methane%20is%20a%20potent%20greenhouse,after%20it%20reaches%20the%20atmosphere.). It is a key driver of climate change, contributing to about 30% of current global warming due to human activities. Methane emissions stem from a variety of anthropogenic and natural sources including oil and gas extraction, agriculture, landfills, and wetlands.

Despite global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, atmospheric methane levels have continued to rise alarmingly, [**increasing at a rate of 0.8% per year from 2020 to 2022**](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_ch4/). This trend underscores the critical need for **effective monitoring and reduction strategies** to mitigate its impact on the climate. High-resolution data from satellite observations reveal that methane emissions are not only persistent but are also **increasing in regions heavily involved in fossil fuel extraction and intensive agriculture**.

Addressing this methane crisis requires **precise quantification** and monitoring—tasks that are complex due to the diffuse and varied nature of methane sources. Without precise data to inform policy and technological solutions, efforts to curb emissions may fall short, making it imperative to [**harness advanced tools like the Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI)**](https://imi.seas.harvard.edu).

The Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group at Harvard University has spent years developing this software, which allows for the detailed quanitification and monitoring of methane emissions. This open-source tool allows anyone to **quantify methane emissions anywhere in the world**.

The IMI serves as a critical tool for both research and policy-making by providing detailed maps and data on global emissions. Researchers use IMI data to enhance scientific understanding of methane dynamics, **contributing to more accurate climate models and peer-reviewed studies**. 

For policymakers, IMI’s precise emission estimates **inform targeted strategies for methane reduction and compliance monitoring**, supporting effective environmental regulations and policy adjustments based on robust empirical evidence. **This dual utility makes the IMI indispensable in the global effort to mitigate climate change impacts**. 

<h2><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/rocket.svg" width="30" height="30"> • Our Mission </h2>


Our goal is to make our emission monitoring platform **accessible to everyone**, from policymakers to industry stakeholders to environmental organizations. We believe that by **empowering people with the knowledge and tools** to quantify methane emissions, we can accelerate the transition to a **sustainable, low-carbon future**. One major step forward in accessibility will be the creation of a website that will make the IMI easier to use for a **wider range of gas trackers**.

The IMI provides invaluable methane emissions data that has been used by researchers, students, and stakeholders. And this data will only get more useful with the [exciting release of IMI 2.0](/development#IMI2). Despite this data's usefulness, the IMI often requires **substantial technical expertise** and access to **computational resources**. 

**Integral Earth** will provide an intuitive, user-friendly interface that simplifies the entire process. Users will be able to easily select their regions of interest, define inversion parameters, and visualize results without needing to understand complex coding or data processing techniques. 

This democratization of access will empower a wider range of stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, and environmental organizations, to leverage high-resolution methane emission data for climate action.
