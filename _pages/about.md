## The Methane Problem
Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is responsible for about 30% of global warming. It is emitted from a variety of sources, including natural gas production, agriculture, and landfills. Reducing anthropogenic methane emissions is a critical step in combating climate change and protecting the environment. However, to implement mitigation strategies we must quantify methane sources, a challenging task that requires specialized equipment and expertise.

## Our Solution
We are a group of researchers at Harvard University who have spent years developing reliable, peer-reviewed algorithms for quantifying and monitoring methane emissions. We have developed a new, open-source tool that allows anyone to quantify methane emissions anywhere in the world: the [Integrated Methane Inversion](https://imi.seas.harvard.edu). Our tool is based on the latest scientific research and is used globally by scientists around the world. 

## Our Mission
Our goal is to make our emission monitoring platform accessible to everyone, from policymakers to industry stakeholders to environmental organizations. We believe that by empowering people with the knowledge and tools to quantify methane emissions, we can accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our work. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:integrated_methane_inversion@seas.harvard.edu). We look forward to hearing from you!
