## The Methane Problem

Methane is a **potent greenhouse gas**, with a global warming potential over [**80 times greater than CO2 over a 20-year period**](https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight#:~:text=Methane%20is%20a%20potent%20greenhouse,after%20it%20reaches%20the%20atmosphere.). It is a key driver of climate change, contributing to about 30% of current global warming due to human activities. Methane emissions stem from a variety of anthropogenic and natural sources including oil and gas extraction, agriculture, landfills, and wetlands.

Despite global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, atmospheric methane levels have continued to rise alarmingly, [**increasing at a rate of 0.8% per year from 2020 to 2022**](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_ch4/). This trend underscores the critical need for **effective monitoring and reduction strategies** to mitigate its impact on the climate. High-resolution data from satellite observations reveal that methane emissions are not only persistent but are also **increasing in regions heavily involved in fossil fuel extraction and intensive agriculture**.

Addressing this methane crisis requires **precise quantification** and monitoringâ€”tasks that are complex due to the diffuse and varied nature of methane sources. Without precise data to inform policy and technological solutions, efforts to curb emissions may fall short, making it imperative to harness advanced tools like the Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI). This tool leverages cutting-edge satellite technology to provide detailed methane emission data across the globe, enabling targeted mitigation strategies that are critical for steering us towards a sustainable, low-carbon future.

## Our Solution

We are a group of researchers at Harvard University who have spent years developing reliable, peer-reviewed algorithms for quantifying and monitoring methane emissions. We have developed a new, open-source tool that allows anyone to quantify methane emissions anywhere in the world: the [Integrated Methane Inversion](https://imi.seas.harvard.edu). Our tool is based on the latest scientific research and is used globally by scientists around the world.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to make our emission monitoring platform accessible to everyone, from policymakers to industry stakeholders to environmental organizations. We believe that by empowering people with the knowledge and tools to quantify methane emissions, we can accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our work. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:integrated_methane_inversion@seas.harvard.edu). We look forward to hearing from you!
