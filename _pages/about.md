## The Methane Problem

Methane is a **potent greenhouse gas**, with a global warming potential over [**80 times greater than CO2 over a 20-year period**](https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight#:~:text=Methane%20is%20a%20potent%20greenhouse,after%20it%20reaches%20the%20atmosphere.). It is a key driver of climate change, contributing to about 30% of current global warming due to human activities. Methane emissions stem from a variety of anthropogenic and natural sources including oil and gas extraction, agriculture, landfills, and wetlands.

Despite global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, atmospheric methane levels have continued to rise alarmingly, [**increasing at a rate of 0.8% per year from 2020 to 2022**](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_ch4/). This trend underscores the critical need for **effective monitoring and reduction strategies** to mitigate its impact on the climate. High-resolution data from satellite observations reveal that methane emissions are not only persistent but are also **increasing in regions heavily involved in fossil fuel extraction and intensive agriculture**.

## Our Solution

Addressing this methane crisis requires **precise quantification** and monitoring—tasks that are complex due to the diffuse and varied nature of methane sources. Without precise data to inform policy and technological solutions, efforts to curb emissions may fall short, making it imperative to [**harness advanced tools like the Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI)**](https://imi.seas.harvard.edu). The Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group at Harvard University has spent years developing this software, which allows for the detailed quanitification and monitoring of methane emissions. This open-source tool allows anyone to **quantify methane emissions anywhere in the world**.

The IMI serves as a critical tool for both research and policy-making by providing detailed maps and data on global emissions. Researchers use IMI data to enhance scientific understanding of methane dynamics, **contributing to more accurate climate models and peer-reviewed studies**. For policymakers, IMI’s precise emission estimates **inform targeted strategies for methane reduction and compliance monitoring**, supporting effective environmental regulations and policy adjustments based on robust empirical evidence. **This dual utility makes the IMI indispensable in the global effort to mitigate climate change impacts**.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to make our emission monitoring platform **accessible to everyone**, from policymakers to industry stakeholders to environmental organizations. We believe that by **empowering people with the knowledge and tools** to quantify methane emissions, we can accelerate the transition to a **sustainable, low-carbon future**. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our work. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact). We look forward to hearing from you!
